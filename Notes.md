# Notes

## Setup

For the language it has to run on the JVM, so lets use Kotlin since im most confortable with that one.

Since I havent used a web framework in kotlin yet, my choices (from the ones i've heard of) are the following:
* Spring (written in java and uses gradle to build)
* Ktor (written in kotlin by jetbrains)

I'm going to go for ktor since its pure kotlin and still has a good backing. Also i dont know how maven deals with
dependencies using gradle. I'd like to avoid gradle if possible. So for build system we'll use maven.

While IDEA is downloading lets look at this TLE format.
After reading its wikipedia page, it seems like a very strict format, does Orekit provide a parser for it?

[Yes it does!](https://www.orekit.org/site-orekit-10.3/architecture/tle.html)

Good! no custom parsers if i dont need to.

Next what else am I going to need?
* Csv parser
* Open weather api

Hopefully Lat and Long values are in decimal, we'll assume that for now, maybe add different formats for that later.

In the tips theres a website to test our accurary, I wonder if they have an api?

Doesn't seem like it :(

Too bad no automated accuracy tests.

## Planning

Right now that I have a general idea lets plan this out.

The way the challenge is written it sounds like they want a front-end (it being an _Application_ and all).
But of one, I suck at front-end stuff, and two, All i know of web front end is in javascript. So I'm sticking with a
web api.

If we want a correct web api, it should be stateless.
So I have two choices:
1. Take all the possible inputs in a single call (json)
2. deal with a database and have multiple routes.

The first one is less painfull on me, but Im willing to bet they have a script that uploads the files for the TLE's and the csv's. So being able to have dedicated File routes could be nicer on them.

BUT dealing with a database is going to be a pain, especially for the test setups.

So we'll stick with the first choice for now, i'll structure the code so it can be exploded to different routes later.


## Issues encountered

with the kotlinx.serialization plugin there seems to be an issue with the kotlin compiler version even though its configured with the correct compiler... I guess were switching to gradle ðŸ™„

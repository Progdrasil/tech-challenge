# Challenges: Embedded Developer

These challenges are very close to what your first mission will look like working at GHGSat. This is thus a very good
way for us to assess your skills and methodology, and for you to understand our business logic and challenges.

If for any reason, you don't feel you will have the time required to complete this challenge and keep a life balance, we 
invite you to showcase a professional or personal project you are proud of. We provision 45 min  to discuss technically 
this project with you. It would be great - but not mandatory - if you can show us some code and describe your 
contributions.

We recognize the above is a lot of work, and we're not expecting everything to be completed, what we're looking for is 
your best effort. They are listed in order of complexity, so we recommend you complete them in order.

Please make your best to complete this assignment within 3 days. Please provide following elements with your answer:

* your source code pushed to a public repository (preferrably not as email attachment),
* a README describing how to use/run your solution

Good Luck!

## Challenge 1: S-expression parser

This challenge is close to what your first mission would look like working at GHGSat. This is thus a very good way for us to assess your skills, and for you to understand the software stack we are using.

Write a simple C or C++ program which:

* parses s-expression file given as input, it shall successfully parses [example.sexp](example.sexp).
* print on stdout each element, in a nested fashion, its data-type and value
* is built from a Makefile or CMake with x86 and ARM targets. Up to you to choose Makefile or CMake for this.
* validate your program on an ARM board (Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, your Android phone or tablet?). If you are missing 
such hardware or its associated toolchain at home, look at ARM qemu emulator and validate your program on it.

Above items are normally listed in ascending order of complexity. It's ok not to complete all of them, make your best.

Provide following elements with your answer:
* your source code pushed to a public repository (e.g. github; **not** as email attachment),
* a README.md describing how to build your project,
* some instructions how to run it on the chosen hardware or emulator environment
* a quick review how you went through this assignment: method, research, problems you faced?
* what would do to improve this software if you were given more time?
